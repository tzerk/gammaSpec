# Dose rate estimation

For a NaI:Tl detector the dose rate $\dot{D}_M$ from count rate $\dot{N'}_M$ can
be estimated using the following linear relationship

\begin{equation}
  \dot{D}_M = m * \dot{N'}_M + \dot{D}_0
\end{equation}

with $m$ being the slope and $\dot{D}_0$ the intercept. Both these parameters must
be estimated by calibration measurements, which must be representative for
the designated use case (e.g. in terms of geometry, material and source spectrum). 
The count rate $\dot{N'}_M$ is calculated from

\begin{equation}
  \dot{N'}_M = \dot{N}_M - \dot{N}_B
\end{equation}

where the measured count rate $\dot{N'}_M$ is subtracted a measured background
count rate $\dot{N'}_B$

Both count rates are calculated with

\begin{equation}
  \dot{N} = \frac{N}{T} \\ = \frac{1}{T} * \displaystyle\sum_{i=k}^{k'}N_i
\end{equation}

where $T$ is the measurement time and $N_i$ are the measured counts in the
$i$th channel. The lowest summation index $k$ is set to a channel closest to 
to a corresponding energy $E$ = 500 keV, while index $k'$ is set to the channel closest to 
$E$ = 4 MeV. These default values were chosen as the differences in photon 
interaction cross sections in quartz and NaI:Tl are smallest in this energy range and thus a 
similar deposition of dose can be expected.

# Calibration

Parameters $m$ and $\dot{D}_0$ of (1) are estimated by separate calibration 
measurements, where the count rates $\dot{N'}_{C1}$ and $\dot{N'}_{C2}$ of 
two known dose rates $\dot{D}_{C1}$ and $\dot{D}_{C2}$ must be determined using
(2) and (3). With these results the coefficients $m$ and $\dot{D}_0$ can be 
calculated with

\begin{equation}
  m = \frac{\dot{D}_{C1} - \dot{D}_{C2}}{\dot{N'}_{C1} - \dot{N'}_{C2}}
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
  \dot{D}_0 = \dot{D}_{C1} - m * \dot{N'}_{C1}
\end{equation}

As both count rates are background corrected the calibration curve can be
expected to include the pair of values $\dot{D} = 0$ and $\dot{N'} = 0$. If only
one calibration spectrum (i.e., $\dot{D}_{C1}$ and $\dot{N'}_{C1}$) is available 
one could simplify (1) by assuming intercept $\dot{D}_0 = 0$.

# Estimating the uncertainty

## Count rate

The uncertainty $\Delta\dot{N}$ on the count rates are assumed to follow 
Poisson statistics:

\begin{equation}
  \Delta\dot{N} = \frac{1}{T} * \sqrt{N} \\
                  = \frac{1}{T} * \sqrt{\dot{N} * T} \\
                  = \frac{\sqrt{\dot{N}} * \sqrt{T}}{\sqrt{T} * \sqrt{T}} \\
                  = \sqrt{\frac{\dot{N}}{T}}
\end{equation}

For the uncertainty on (2) it follows

\begin{equation}
  \Delta\dot{N'}_M = \sqrt{(\Delta\dot{N}_M)^2 + (\Delta\dot{N}_B)^2}
\end{equation}

which can also analogously be applied to all other count rates.

## Calibration

Deduced from (7) and known $\dot{D}_{C1}$ and $\dot{D}_{C2}$ 
the uncertainty on (4) is estimated by 

\begin{equation}
  \Delta{m} = m * \sqrt{
    (\frac{\Delta\dot{D}_{C1}}{\dot{D}_{C1} - \dot{D}_{C2}})^2 +
    (\frac{\Delta\dot{D}_{C2}}{\dot{D}_{C1} - \dot{D}_{C2}})^2 +
    (\frac{\Delta\dot{N}_{C1}}{\dot{N}_{C1} - \dot{N}_{C2}})^2 +
    (\frac{\Delta\dot{N}_{C2}}{\dot{N}_{C1} - \dot{N}_{C2}})^2
  }
\end{equation}

In consideration of (8) the uncertainty on (5) is estimated by

\begin{equation}
  \Delta\dot{D}_0 = \sqrt{
    (\Delta\dot{D}_{C1})^2 +
    (\dot{N'}_{C1} * \Delta{m})^2 +
    (m * \Delta\dot{N'}_{C1})^2
  }
\end{equation}

## Measured dose rate

Finally, with (8) and (9) the uncertainty on the measured dose rate $\dot{D}_M$,
estimated in (1), is calculated with

\begin{equation}
  \Delta\dot{D}_M = \sqrt{
    (\dot{N'}_M * \Delta{m})^2 +
    (m * \Delta{\dot{N'}_M})^2 +
    (\Delta\dot{D}_0)^2
  }
\end{equation}
